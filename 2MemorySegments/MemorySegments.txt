- 3 sections of an asm program represent MEMORY SEGMENTS
- can replace 'section' keyword with 'segment'

Memory Segments
---------------

- segmented memory model diveds system memory into groups of independent segments
- segments referenced by pointers located in segment registers
- each segment contain specific type of data
	1 - instruction codes
	2 - data elements
	3 - program stack

Data Segment
- .data and .bss sections
- .data section declares memory region (where data elements stored for program)
- cannot be expanded after data elements are declared (remains static throughout program)
- .bss section also static
	- constains buffers for data to be declared later in program
	- buffer memory is zero-filled

Code Segment
- .text section
- defines area in memeory that stored instruction codes
- fixed area

Stack
- contains data values passed to functions
- conatins procedures within the program
