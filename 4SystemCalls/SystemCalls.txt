Linux System Calls
------------------

to use in asm programs:
- put system call number in EAX register
- store args to system call in registers EBX, ECX, etc
- call relevant interrupt
- result usually returned in EAX register

Six registers store args of the system call used
- EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP
	- take consecutive args, starting with EBX
- if more than 6 args, memory location stored in ebx reg
