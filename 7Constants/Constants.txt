- several directives provided by NASM to defined constants. three are:
	- EQU
	- %assign
	- %define

The EQU Directive
- used for defining constants
- syntax: 

	CONSTANT_NAME EQU expression

- example

	TOTAL_STUDENTS EQU 50

- can then use constant in code:

	mov  ecx,  TOTAL_STUDENTS
	cmp  eax,  TOTAL_STUDENTS

- operand can be expression
	
	LENGTH equ 20
	WIDTH  equ 10
	AREA   equ length * width

The %assign Directive
- used to defined numeric constants like EQU 
- BUT allows redefinition
- example

	%assign TOTAL 10
	%assign TOTAL 20

- case-sensitive

The %define Directive
- allows defining both numeric and string constants
- similar to #define in C
- example
	
	%define PTR [EBP+4]

- allows redefinition and is case-sensitive
